# svySFTP

This module requires that the Jsch library for SSH is in the classpath.
The project homefor this library is http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/

The jsch.jar can be downloaded from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsch/files/jsch.jar/0.1.53/jsch-0.1.53.jar/download

NOTE: There is no jnlp file available for this resource currently and the library is not signed by Servoy.
